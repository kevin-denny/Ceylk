Asian elephants, sloth bears, leopards, sambar, and \r\n           wild buffaloes draw the most of the interest of wildlife enthusiasts out of the \r\n           ninety-one species of mammals present in Sri Lanka. The Red Slender Loris, Toque \r\n           Macaque, and Purple-faced Langur, however, are the rarest mammals in Sri Lanka and \r\n           are deemed to be endangered owing to habitat loss by the IUCN.<br>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p class=\"mainP\">\r\n           Large families of cetaceans, including powerful blue whales, \r\n           sperm whales, and playful dolphins, reside in the seas near Sri Lanka. \r\n           The waterways around the nation are home to 26 different species of cetaceans, making it \r\n           one of the greatest places in the world to go whale and dolphin watching.<br>\r\n           \r\n           Although the island is home to unique amphibians and powerful elephants, birds are \r\n           the pride of Sri Lanka's fauna. With over 433 bird species, 233 of which are resident, \r\n           Sri Lanka is home to 20 endemic species.

The public may \r\n                now access two blocks. <br></p>\r\n    \r\n                <p>Yala was established as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and as a national park in 1938. \r\n                It is located in Sri Lanka's south-east, abutting the expansive Indian Ocean. Ironically, \r\n                while Britain was in power, the park was first utilized as a hunting area for the affluent. \r\n                215 bird species and 44 different types of mammals may be found in Yala. The largest \r\n                concentration of leopards, stately elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, \r\n                peacocks, and crocodiles are just a few of its most well-known inhabitants. <br></p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <div class=\"column3\">\r\n            <h3>MINNERIYA NATIONAL PARK</h3>\r\n            <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/Minneriya.jpg\" alt=\"Minneriya\">\r\n                <p>In Sri Lanka's North Central Province, 182 miles from Colombo, is where you'll find Minneriya \r\n                National Park.
