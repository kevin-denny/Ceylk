One of the oldest continuously inhabited\r\n        towns in the world and Sri Lanka's third and longest-serving capital is\r\n        also one of the most revered by Buddhists worldwide.

It functioned as a palace for King Buvanekabahu and a\r\n            military bastion against invasions from the north. A long, steep ornate\r\n            stairway leads to the Tooth Temple, where the Tooth Relic was carried\r\n            from Dambadeniya in 1272 before being kidnapped to South India by the\r\n            Pandyas in 1284.

He painted murals on the walls and constructed a\r\n            magnificent castle directly atop the granite column. The palace was only\r\n            accessible by a huge carved lion's mouth.
